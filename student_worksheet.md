## Part 1: Individual Readiness (Complete Before Class)

Before the team session, read the relevant chapters from "The Goal" and review the problem scenario. Then answer these questions individually:

### A. Conceptual Understanding

1. **In "The Goal," what is the definition of a bottleneck?**

   Your answer:
   
   
   
   

2. **According to Goldratt, which of these statements is TRUE?**
   - [ ] All resources should operate at 100% efficiency
   - [ ] An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is an hour saved for the system
   - [ ] The bottleneck determines the throughput of the entire system
   - [ ] We should maximize local efficiency at all workstations

3. **What are Goldratt's three core operational measurements?**
   
   a. _________________________
   
   b. _________________________
   
   c. _________________________

### B. Problem Analysis

4. **Given the default parameters:**
   - Heat Treatment capacity: 160 hours/week
   - Product A: requires 4 hours at Heat Treatment, profit = $90
   - Product B: requires 2 hours at Heat Treatment, profit = $60
   
   **Without running the optimization, which product would you expect to produce more of? Why?**
   
   Your reasoning:
   
   
   
   

5. **Calculate: How much profit does each product generate per hour of bottleneck time?**
   
   Product A: $_______ per bottleneck hour

    | Product A quantity | _______ | _______ |
    | Product B quantity | _______ | _______ |
    | Total throughput | $_______ | $_______ |
    
    **At what profit level for Product A does the optimal mix change?**
    
    Answer: $_______ (test different values to find the switch point)

## Part 3: Application Exercise

### E. Investment Decision Analysis

Your plant has $100,000 to invest. Use the shadow prices from the Constraint Sensitivity Analysis to answer:

11. **Record the shadow prices for each constraint:**

    | Constraint | Shadow Price |
    |------------|--------------|
    | Machining capacity | $_______ |
    | Heat Treatment capacity | $_______ |
    | Assembly capacity | $_______ |
    | Product A demand | $_______ |
    | Product B demand | $_______ |

12. **Investment options available:**
    - Option A: Add 20 hours of Heat Treatment capacity for $80,000
    - Option B: Add 50 hours of Machining capacity for $60,000
    - Option C: Marketing campaign to increase Product A demand by 20 units for $40,000
    
    **Calculate the annual value of each investment (assuming 52 weeks/year):**
    
    | Option | Annual Value | Cost | Net Benefit (Year 1) | ROI |
    |--------|--------------|------|----------------------|-----|
    | A | $_______ | $80,000 | $_______ | _____% |
    | B | $_______ | $60,000 | $_______ | _____% |
    | C | $_______ | $40,000 | $_______ | _____% |
    
    **Which investment should you choose? Why?**
    
    Team recommendation:

## Part 4: Connecting to "The Goal"

### F. Theoretical Application

13. **The Five Focusing Steps - Apply them to this problem:**

    Step 1 (IDENTIFY): What is the system's constraint?
    
    
    
    Step 2 (EXPLOIT): How should you exploit this constraint?
    
    
    
    Step 3 (SUBORDINATE): How should other resources subordinate to this decision?
    
    
    
    Step 4 (ELEVATE): If you elevate the constraint, what happens?
    
    
    
    Step 5 (REPEAT): After elevation, what becomes the new constraint?
    
    
    

14. **The Herbie Analogy:**
    
    In the book, the boy scout troop goes on a hike and Herbie (the slowest hiker) determines the group's pace.
    
    **How does this relate to your optimization results?**
    
    Team analysis:
    
    
    
    
    **What happens when someone in front of Herbie speeds up?**
    
    
    
    
    **What should you do instead?**
    
    
    
    

15. **Statistical Fluctuations and Dependent Events:**
    
    Goldratt emphasizes that problems arise from the combination of statistical fluctuations and dependent events.
    
    **In this optimization model, how do the three work centers represent dependent events?**
    
    
    
    
    **What would happen if each work center tried to achieve 100% utilization independently?**
